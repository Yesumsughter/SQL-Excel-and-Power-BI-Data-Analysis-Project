# DATA PROFESSIONALS’ SALARY DISTRIBUTION AND GROWTH TREND ANALYSIS (2020-2023)
## Project Objective
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of salary distribution and growth trends among data
professionals, including Data Analysts, Data Architects, Data Engineers, Data Scientists, and
Machine Learning Specialists, over a four-year period (2020_2023). The dataset, containing 11
columns and 3,755 rows, includes variables such as work year, job title, salary, company size
(small, medium, large), employment type (full-time, part-time, contract, freelance), experience
level (senior, expert, entry, experienced) e.t.c
## The analysis addressed key questions, such as:
● Salary statistics (average, minimum, and maximum) of data professionals.

● Trends in salary over the years among data professionals.

● Distribution of salaries across experience levels of data professionals.

● The impact of company size and employment type on salary distribution of data
professionals.

● Top-paying countries for data professionals.

● Data professionals with the highest growth trends over the years.

## Methodology
To ensure accurate and actionable insights, the dataset was cleaned, transformed, and analyzed
using a combination of tools.
## Tools used for analysis
The tools used for this analysis are Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerBI and SQL Server
## Data Cleaning and Transformation
Excel: Missing values were identified and handled appropriately. Duplicates
were removed, and data types were standardised.

Power BI: The dataset was loaded for transformation, including renaming
columns and replacing of values to standardise the data set
## Data Analysis
SQL: Structured Query Language (SQL) was used to perform in-depth analysis,
answering each of the key questions with queries designed to explore
relationships, compute aggregates, and identify trends.
## Visualization
Power BI: Charts and dashboards were created to visually represent insights,
such as salary trends over time, distributions, and comparisons across categories
like job titles, experience levels, and company sizes.
## Maintaining Data Integrity
Throughout the transformation process, the paramount goal was to uphold data integrity,
preserving the reliability and trustworthiness of the dataset
