# DATA PROFESSIONALS’ SALARY DISTRIBUTION AND GROWTH TREND ANALYSIS (2020-2023)
## Project Objective
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of salary distribution and growth trends among data
professionals, including Data Analysts, Data Architects, Data Engineers, Data Scientists, and
Machine Learning Specialists, over a four-year period (2020_2023). The dataset, containing 11
columns and 3,755 rows, includes variables such as work year, job title, salary, company size
(small, medium, large), employment type (full-time, part-time, contract, freelance), experience
level (senior, expert, entry, experienced) e.t.c
## The analysis addressed key questions, such as:
● Salary statistics (average, minimum, and maximum) of data professionals.

● Trends in salary over the years among data professionals.

● Distribution of salaries across experience levels of data professionals.

● The impact of company size and employment type on salary distribution of data
professionals.

● Top-paying countries for data professionals.

● Data professionals with the highest growth trends over the years.

## Methodology
To ensure accurate and actionable insights, the dataset was cleaned, transformed, and analyzed
using a combination of tools.
## Tools used for analysis
The tools used for this analysis are Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerBI and SQL Server
## Data Cleaning and Transformation
Excel: Missing values were identified and handled appropriately. Duplicates
were removed, and data types were standardised.

Power BI: The dataset was loaded for transformation, including renaming
columns and replacing of values to standardise the data set
## Data Analysis
SQL: Structured Query Language (SQL) was used to perform in-depth analysis,
answering each of the key questions with queries designed to explore
relationships, compute aggregates, and identify trends.
## Visualization
Power BI: Charts and dashboards were created to visually represent insights,
such as salary trends over time, distributions, and comparisons across categories
like job titles, experience levels, and company sizes.
## Maintaining Data Integrity
Throughout the transformation process, the paramount goal was to uphold data integrity,
preserving the reliability and trustworthiness of the dataset

The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle, a platform offering a wide range of
publicly available datasets. Kaggle’s datasets provide a rich and reliable foundation for data
analysis and insights. This particular dataset was pre-processed to ensure quality and
consistency before analysis.
## Questions to be answered
The following questions were answered from the data set with visualisation and SQL codes
written to answer the questions
1. What is the total number of Data Professionals
2. What is the distribution of job titles in the dataset?
3. Salary statistics (average, minimum, and maximum) by job title over the years
4. What is the distribution of salaries across experience levels and job titles.
5. The impact of company size and employment type on salary.
6. What are the top 5 paying countries for data professionals?
7. Which Job title has the highest growth trends over the years.

## Conclusion
The analysis of salary trends and job distributions among data professionals reveals key
insights into the evolving landscape of the data industry. The demand for specialized roles like
Machine Learning Specialists and Data Scientists is evident, with these positions experiencing
the highest growth in both salary and market demand, reflecting the increasing reliance on AI,
machine learning, and advanced analytics across industries. Data Engineers also saw significant
salary growth, underscoring the critical role of building and maintaining data infrastructure in
today’s data-driven world.
On the other hand, roles such as Data Architects, while high-paying, showed signs of
stabilization after an initial surge, indicating a more niche demand. Data Analysts, though
integral to many organizations, experienced slower but steady growth, highlighting their more
generalist skill set compared to other specialized roles.
The impact of company size on salary distribution further emphasizes that larger companies
tend to offer more competitive compensation, particularly for specialized roles. Geographically,
the USA remains the dominant market for data professionals, offering significantly higher
salaries compared to other regions, though countries like the UK and Canada also provide
attractive opportunities.
In conclusion, professionals looking to advance in the data field should focus on acquiring
specialized skills in areas like machine learning and data science, while also considering factors
such as company size and location to maximize career growth and salary potential.
Understanding these trends will help both data professionals and organizations make informed
decisions to navigate the rapidly evolving data landscape
